# What is that?
Just a recipes app made using React for tutorial purpses.

# How to run?

Clone the repository, and then run `yarn` or `npm install`.  
After it finishes installing the dependencies, run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`.  
Then you can access it on `localhost:3000` or any other port if 3000 was used.  
*It's not the best looking project*
